<h1 id="package-manager-pix">Package Manager (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code>)</h1>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> is the KOOMPI OS package manager that is easy to use with support for installing packages from multiple sources inside containers without altering the root filesystem.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> introduces a whole new paradigm in package management. The idea is to use 
your system only as a box for storing your files, leaving it clean of packages 
and limiting the risk of breaking due to incompatible, poorly constructed or 
conflicting packages.</p>

<p>It gets done by installing software inside one or more containers fully managed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> having restricted access to your system’s resources while still being able to use the same drivers, display server, etc.</p>

<p>Your home directory is mapped inside the container so you can access your 
configuration files, preferences and other vital data needed by the installed 
packages, as well as being able to access your files from the installed 
software, e.g. by opening a file in LibreOffice.</p>

<h3 id="host-system">Host system</h3>

<p>While installing software on the host is against the project’s ideology, there are cases where it is essential. For example, when you need to 
install a kernel module or driver.</p>

<p>In cases like this, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abroot exec apt install &lt;package_name&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abroot shell apt install &lt;package_name&gt;</code> command to bypass the container and install directly on the host, <em>but be aware that this 
is not recommended</em>.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-sources">Multiple sources</h3>

<p>By default, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> provides a container based on your Linux distribution (Ubuntu 
22.10 for KOOMPI OS 22.10) and wraps all commands from the distribution’s 
package manager (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> for Ubuntu).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, you can install packages from package other distributions. For example, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--aur</code> flag, a new
container based on Arch Linux will be created. Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> will manage the packages 
from the AUR (Pacman and yay), tightly integrating them with the host system. Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--dnf</code> flag with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> will create a new container based on Fedora Linux. Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> will manage packages from Fedora’s DNF repository,  tightly integrating them with the host system.</p>

<p>For GUI packages created inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> containers,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.desktop</code> files are created automatically and added to the Applications menu. These applications are displayed beside other applications in the “Open with” menu in nautilus. GUI Packages installed inside containers gets shown in the Sub System section in the <a href="/docs/koompi-control-center">KOOMPI control center</a>.</p>

<p>For quality control, we are limiting this feature to specific implementations. Currently, only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--aur</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--dnf</code> flags are supported, but 
we are planning to implement support for the Nix package manager as well in future.</p>

<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>

<p>The name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pix</code> can be read as PI’X, this package manager also can be read as pixel. <strong>X</strong> consists of two lines (host and container) overlapping each other, where the container is on top, meaning 
it is on top of the host system.</p>
